# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies. The Risk Manager and Communication Lead play key roles in ensuring effective risk management and transparent communication across OctoAcme projects.

## Roles Overview

### Risk Manager
The Risk Manager proactively identifies, assesses, tracks, and mitigates project risks. They maintain the risk register, develop mitigation plans, and lead escalation paths. See [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed responsibilities.

### Communication Lead
The Communication Lead maintains transparency and ensures timely communication across teams and stakeholders. They own communication channels, status reporting, and escalation communications. See [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed responsibilities.

## Risk Register
The Risk Manager maintains a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

For accountability clarification on risk management activities, see the [Responsibility Matrix](octoacme-responsibility-matrix.md).

## Risk Lifecycle
The Risk Manager leads the risk lifecycle process:
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

The Risk Manager collaborates with Project Managers, developers, and other team members throughout this process.

## Stakeholder Communication
The Communication Lead works with Project Managers to:
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Ensure timely and transparent communication across all stakeholder groups

## Communication Templates
The Communication Lead maintains and uses these templates for consistent communication:

Weekly Status Template:
- Progress this week:
- Next steps:
- Risks & blockers:
- Ask / decisions needed:

Incident Communication
- Triage summary
- Actions being taken
- Expected timeline
- Post-incident blameless retrospective scheduled

The Communication Lead coordinates with the Risk Manager for risk-related communications.

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level -> PM -> Product Lead -> Sponsor
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call

The Risk Manager and Communication Lead work together to ensure proper escalation communication and stakeholder notification. See the [Responsibility Matrix](octoacme-responsibility-matrix.md) for escalation accountability.
