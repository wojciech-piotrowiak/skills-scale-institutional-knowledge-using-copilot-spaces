# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions

## Minimum Deliverables
